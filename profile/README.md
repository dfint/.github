## Install the localization:

[![dfint/installer](https://img.shields.io/badge/dfint%2Finstaller-forestgreen?style=for-the-badge)
](https://github.com/dfint/installer)

If the installer doesn't work for you for some reason (e.g. it doesn't run at all), you can use the package builder:

[![Package builder](https://img.shields.io/badge/Package%20builder-blue?style=for-the-badge)
](https://dfint-package-build.streamlit.app/)

Supported versions of DF are 50.10 and newer (including 51 versions), provided there is a config for the corresponding version. Both Windows and Linux platforms are supported.

We try to update configs as soon as possible after a game update (typically 1-3 days, or about a week in hard cases).

## What is Dwarf Fortress?

<sup>(if you accidentally stumbled upon this project)</sup>

In short, it is an indirect control strategy, very similar to [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/), but in a fantasy setting (in fact, Rimworld was inspired by Dwarf Fortress).
