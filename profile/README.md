We create tools for fan-made localization of Dwarf Fortress game.

* [**df-steam-hook**](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook) - current localization patch/hook for DF 50.04 and newer, provided there is a config for the corresponding version. We are trying to update configs as soon as possible after update of the game.
  See instructions in the readme of the repository and the patch itself in the [releases](https://github.com/dfint/df-steam-hook/releases).
* Autogenerated csv files with translations see [**here**](https://github.com/dfint/autobuild/tree/main/translation_build). Use these files along with the `df-steam-hook` mentioned above. The files are automatically updated once a day (if there are any changes on transifex).

## What is Dwarf Fortress?

<sup>(if you accidentally stumbled upon this project)</sup>

In short, it is an indirect control strategy, very similar to [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/), but in a fantasy setting (in fact, Rimworld was inspired by Dwarf Fortress).
